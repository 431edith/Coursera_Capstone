    "### Problem Statement: Prospects and Competitive Landscape for a Mexican Restaurant in New York City\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "New York has an estimated 18,804,000 people, a very densely populated and major city in the United States. It consists of five boroughs: Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Bronx and Staten Island, and more than 300 neighborhoods. Our goal is to find a good neighborhood for opening a Mexican Restaurant in New York and what the competive landscape looks like.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Audience:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Individuals looking into opening a Mexican restaurant. This will provide an analysis of whether the venture is feasible and what the competitive landscape is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investors that seek to invest in the opening of the company. This analysis will highlight potential areas to start or expand a business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Residents or visitors looking for Mexican restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good location is a safe place with good amount of consumers’ footfall who can afford the product and where the cost of doing business is optimum. This means data required for this purpose are: population density, demographics, purchasing power, and competitors. In this project, data on population density, purchasing power (i.e, per capita income) and competitors (foursquare location data) has been used.\n",

    "**3C.** After transforming the data, we will be using K-means clustering. In our problem, clustering helps to divide the neighborhoods of a given borough into clusters so that each neighborhood in a given cluster will show the venues with respect to the other neighborhoods within the same cluster. This will also show the dissimilarity with respect to the neighborhoods present in the different clusters. \n",

    "We used Foursquare data on venues within a 500-meter radius of each neighborhood in Manhattan.

We will plot the mean value of Mexican restaurants for each selected neighborhood in the cluster to study the presence of competition in each neighborhood.\n",

Of these neighborhoods, it is also the most populated. East Harlem has at least double the competition than the other neighborhoods.

    "This project aimed at identifying a potential neighborhood to open a restaurant in New York City. For which neighborhood in New York City offers the greatest population density and which neighborhood offers the greatest per capita income. In this study, we concluded that Manhattan offers both, most people and also the greatest purchasing power of the population of the other four boroughs in New York.\n",
    "We obtained the location data of different types of venues with Foursquare API. This locational data aided us in identifying which cluster had restaurants as the most common venue in Manhattan.\n",
    "Neighborhoods were partitioned into different clusters using K-means clustering algorithm. Further analysis identified that for a Mexican restaurant, East Harlem provides the most competition, which will provide a harder ground to break. However, East Harlem is the most populated of the 20 neighborhoods analyzed. The 9 neighborhoods with moderate competition also had a lower population density than the top 3 neighborhoods with the most average number of Mexican Restaurants.\n",

This can benefit investors that seek to invest in the opening of the company by highlighting potential areas to start or expand a business. Lastly, this can assist residents or visitors by providing the areas with the most amount of Mexican restaurants per neighborhood.\n",
